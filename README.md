# 🎶 Strudel Boom Bap + RNB Live Coding Beat

This project is a live coded music composition built using **Strudel**, a JavaScript based pattern music environment.

The goal of this piece was to explore **boom bap drum grooves paired with RNB style piano harmony**, while structuring the code like a real song instead of a static loop.

## 🧠 How It Works

The code is organized into three layers:

### 1. Core musical parts
- Drums (kick, snare, hats)
- Shaker texture
- Piano chord progression
- Bass following chord roots

### 2. Song sections
- Intro (filtered chords + vinyl texture)
- Build (gradual percussion and filter movement)
- Drop (full groove)
- Breakdown (energy pullback)

### 3. Arrangement
Sections are sequenced into a full song structure using `arrange`, turning musical patterns into a complete composition.

## 🎧 Why This Exists
This project demonstrates creative coding, musical structure, and readable abstractions. It treats code as a compositional tool, blending engineering concepts with musical intuition. It reminds me why I absolutely love Open Source communities, especially ones that thrive at the cross section of creativity and tech!
